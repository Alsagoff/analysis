Write ups from mini projects and experiments

## Markov Prints
This includes a pdf containing the outputs from generating images with a Markov Model. Inspired by and using [William Anderson's](https://magenta.as/using-machine-learning-to-make-art-84df7d3bb911) code. This project uses a personally curated dataset of floral prints scraped from Pinterest. This is then further split into 3 sets, where 2 of them have been manually edited for further analysis. 

## ASOS Insta Analysis
Written in colab using a dataset of 1000+ images from ASOS instagram account. This notebook analyses the posts on ASOS' instagram page to see if there is any pattern to their posting. Using unsupervised learning, the images are grouped together by similarity to reveal what kinds of posts make up a popular social media page like ASOS. There is also a seperate pdf file to go along with it that goes deeper into analysing the different outputs generated.
